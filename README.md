# Project: Function Frontend
In this project I created a smart contract with two unique additional functions I added. I create a frontend where the function's results can be seen by the user.


## Description
In this project, I completed the requirements for my ETH+AVAX Metacrafters course, Module 2, by creating a smart contract project with a frontend that reflects the results of functions.
